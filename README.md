# Python
<p>In this section, there are several python Code for Machine Learning (ML) and Data Analysis Project (DA).</p>

<li><a href="https://github.com/fikriathalariq/python/blob/main/Chicken_Body_Weight_Measurement_Based_Image_Processing.ipynb">Chicken Body Weight Measurement using Image Processing Based Detectron2</a></li>
The "Chicken Body Weight Measurement using Image Processing Based on Detectron2" project aims to develop an innovative and efficient system for estimating the body weight of chickens through image analysis. This system leverages state-of-the-art object detection techniques provided by Detectron2, a powerful computer vision library, to automate the measurement process. By eliminating the need for manual weighing, this project enhances the efficiency and accuracy of monitoring the growth of chickens in various poultry farming environments.
